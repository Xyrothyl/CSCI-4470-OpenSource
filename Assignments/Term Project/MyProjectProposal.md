Linux Kernel
===========
[git repo](https://git.kernel.org/)
[torvalds git hub](https://github.com/torbalds/linux)

Overview
--------
I've decided to work on the linux kernel as my project in order to take advantage of this learning opportunity on some super low level systems at the same time as I'm taking operating systems. Low level programming is one of my biggest interests in computer science and just to start writing a patch requires one to dig around in the kernel and figure out how things work.

As a titan of open source itself, Linux will continue to grow and develop regardless of any contribution I may make. However, beyond academic reasons, my intentions with taking on this project are primarily to learn more about the kernel and how it works by playing around with it.

Semester Plan
-------------
It seems difficult to have a patch accepted in the timeframe we have so my plan should at least try to incorporate tasks throughout the canonical workflow. Aside from the coding itself, I mean to set up and tune the development environment for the kernel, as the toolchain is important in maintaining the codebase at scale.

Milestones
----------
Milestones are given as weeks from project start:

- By Week 1 : Investigate the **Unknown** language options and choose one best suited to encapsulate what we don't know.
- By Week 4 : Obtain unknown information on 6 things that 6 random strangers don't know.
- By Week 7 : Have the informaton from the last stranger. We assume that strangers who don't know things will become harder to find once more people know what we are doing.
- By Week 9: Have the seven unknowns coded into the chosen (unknown) language.
- By Week 10 : Completely develop the website that uses deep learning and artificial intelligence to source a cooperative crowd, decide what they don't know and automatically encode it into the chosen language.
