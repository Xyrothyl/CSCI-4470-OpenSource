# Project Final Report

We will have presentations on your projects during class on 8/16. I currently have 9 projects on the schedule. We will plan on 8 minutes per project. Please  prepare no more than 10 slides covering:

* Your project title
* Team members
* Your description and goals for the semester
    * Make sure you differentiate work done for this course from any work done for another course or for independent study
* Project organization (see the PROJECT rubric)
* Contributions 
* Progress / issues 
* Demo if possible
* Please include 1 appendix per person where you call out, and provide pointers to your project contributions! This does not count against the 10 slide limit.

The goal will be to get through all 9 projects ***in one day***! It will be packed! Our project order is:
