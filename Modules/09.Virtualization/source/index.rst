Introduction
============

What is Virtualization?
-----------------------

.. pull-quote:: In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources. [1]_ 

.. [1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization

.. nextslide::

We will consider two main types:

* Virtual Machines

  * Software to allow a piece of hardware to run multiple operating system images at the same time

  * Eg. *VirtualBox*

* Containers

  * A lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it

  * Eg. *Docker*

Virtual Machines
================

Concept
-------

In a Virtual Machine:

* A software layer *(hypervisor)* emulates the underlying hardware

* An additional operating system runs on the virtual hardware

* Users interact with the virtualization layer as if it were the underlying machine

Architecture

https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/#/virtual_machines

Advantages
----------

* Virtual Machines share resources

  * Memory, disk, network bandwidth

  * Better resource utilization

* They run in isolated environments

  * Better security

* The same hardware can run multiple operating systems

  * Eg. Windows and Linux can coexist on the same machine at the same time

.. nextslide::

* An entire environment can be distributed

  * Less time wasted setting up environments

  * Less confusion about versions or compatibilities

* Machine states can be checkpointed

  * Can be migrated to a more or less powerful machine as needed

  * Rapid return of services when hardware goes down

Disadvantages
-------------

* Virtual Machines share resources

  * Memory, disk, network bandwidth

  * Poor planning and multiple VMs can drown a machine

* The same hardware can run multiple operating systems

  * May require multiple licenses

  * A problem with one set of hardware can affect hundreds of VMs

.. nextslide::

* An entire environment can be distributed

  * The entire guest environment -- including the entire guest OS, disk and memory -- needs to be represented in the VM file

    * VMs are large

  * Each environment communicates to resources through the hypervisor

    * Guest OS <-> hypervisor <-> native OS

      * Can significantly impact performance

* Machine states can be checkpointed

  * Checkpoint files can be huge

Virtualization and the Cloud
----------------------------

Virtual machine are the *de facto* way of using cloud compute resources

* **You** are protected by the virtual environment by interference from other VMs

* Other VMs, and the provider, are protected from **you** as well

* You can easily add VMs or migrate to more/less powerful VMs as your needs change

.. nextslide::

You do not necessarily know what hardware you are running on

* Performance can be different on different systems

* Performance can be different on different clusters

* Performance can be different in different locations (proximity sometimes matters)

An Example
==========

The VA Scheduling Competition
-----------------------------

An interesting cloud use for Virtual Machines: https://vascheduling.devpost.com/

* The VA was investigating a new scheduler for their Electronic Health Recorder (EHR) system

  * Contestants were each given a Virtual Machine with access to nominal (simulated) patient data and a version of a running VISTA EHR

    * The machines ran in the cloud on Rackspace https://www.rackspace.com/

.. nextslide::

* The VA scheduler (continued):

  * They developed their scheduling solution on the system

  * At the end of the competition, the machines were checkpointed and submitted to OSHERA (Open Source Electronic Health Record Agent) for evaluation

* Three awards were given:

  1. https://devpost.com/software/health-etime

  2. https://devpost.com/software/oh-scheduler

  3. https://devpost.com/software/hp-open-community-team-submission

VirtualBox
===========

VirtualBox
----------

.. image:: static/virtualbox.png

https://www.virtualbox.org/

.. nextslide::

Virtualbox is supported by Oracle and comes with a full suite of documentation and other useful information

* Licensing:
  
  * GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2

* Documents:
  
  * https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/UserManual.html

* Getting VirtualBox:

* Community

  * https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Community

* Issue Tracker

  * https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/20939 

.. nextslide::

* Runs on:

  *  Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Solaris

* Guest OS:

  * Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10)
   
  * DOS/Windows 3.x
    
  * Linux (2.4, 2.6, 3.x and 4.x)
    
  * Solaris

.. nextslide::

* Guest OS continued:
    
  * OpenSolaris
  
  * OS/2
    
  * OpenBSD

  * Other ... https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Guest_OSes

* Licensing:

  * VirtualBox is Open Source, but you still need permission for any guest operating system you use

  * In particular, Windows requires appropriate licensing

.. nextslide::

A simple interface can be used to define your virtual machine

.. image:: static/VBInterface.png
  :scale: 40

.. nextslide::

* The image can then be launched using the Virtualbox program

  * It gives a window where the entire guest operating system can be accessed

* Other buttons allow you to stop and checkpoint (save) the current state

.. nextslide::

* Be careful provisioning your image:
  
  * There is an inherent trade-off between image capabilities (size/memory) and VM compactness

  * That said, changing the size can be a pain

  * In general, you want to use the smallest VM that meets your needs

Containers
==========

Concept
-------

.. pull-quote:: A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings. [3]_

.. [3] https://goo.gl/3oDqKD

.. nextslide::

In a Container, the abstraction is to the application layer instead of the hardware layer:

* The application layer interacts directly with a *Container* layer

  * There is no Guest OS layer

  * The guest layer capabilities come in as shared services in the docker layer

  * The containers share the operating system kernel

* Each container runs as an application in user space

* Containers are stateless and use the existing system resources to store data and state

Advantages
----------

* Containers were designed to solve some of the issues of VMs. Paticularly,

  * Large image sizes

  * High latency

  * Reduced performance

* By linking directly to the host kernel, containers:

  * Can have a reduced size

  * Can share resources

  * Can have improved performance

Disadvantages
-------------

Since containers are built from the bottom up, they can be very compact and light weight, but that means that you need to install/configure everything you want to use in your container.

Docker Images
-------------

Docker maintains a library of images that you can run, i.e.:

.. code-block:: console

  $ docker images
  REPOSITORY          TAG       IMAGE ID     CREATED       SIZE
  python              3.5       99034fcd3ca6 2 weeks ago   917MB

  docker/whalesay     latest    6b362a9f73eb 3 years ago   247MB

.. nextslide::

You can spawn a container by running an image.

.. code-block:: console

  $ docker run -it docker/whalesay
  root@40aa8aadc15f:/cowsay# cowsay squirt
   ________ 
  < squirt >
   -------- 
      \
       \
        \     
                      ##        .            
                ## ## ##       ==            
             ## ## ## ##      ===            
         /""""""""""""""""___/ ===        
    ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~   
         \______ o          __/            
          \    \        __/             
            \____\______/   
  root@40aa8aadc15f:/cowsay# exit

.. nextslide::

You can find out what images you have running with

.. code-block:: console

  Wesleys-MacBook-Pro:Virtualization_Lecture wes$ docker ps
  CONTAINER ID IMAGE    COMMAND     CREATED    STATUS    PORTS NAMES
  eec278129a30 mongodev "/bin/bash" 5 days ago Up 5 days       zen_williams

.. nextslide::

You can create new images by:

1. Create a DockerFile to define your image

2. Run a docker build to turn your configuration into an image

3. Run just like a pre-canned image

4. Once you have build a docker image, it will appear when you run *docker images*

5. Alternately, you can use a yaml file to define multiple images that work together to create a system

We will explore all of these in the following example.

Quick Cheat Sheet
-----------------

.. code-block:: console

  ## List Docker CLI commands
  docker
  docker container --help
  
  ## Display Docker version and info
  docker --version
  docker version
  docker info
  
  ## Execute Docker image
  docker run hello-world
  
  ## List Docker images
  docker image ls
  
  ## List Docker containers (running, all, all in quiet mode)
  docker container ls
  docker container ls --all
  docker container ls -aq

Example
-------

As a class exercise, we will run through steps 1-4 of the Docker Tutorial at: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

* Errata

  * Where the Dockerfile says 12-alpine, use 14-alpine

  * Where the Dockerfile says python2, use python3

.. nextslide::

For those of you running on WSL, there may be a few more steps:

* Follow the directions to download the Windows Desktop

* Then go to: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

* And Finally: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/
