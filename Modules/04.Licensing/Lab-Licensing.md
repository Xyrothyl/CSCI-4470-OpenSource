## This Lab is on Open Source Licensing.
Some good reading materials are [OSI's License page](http://opensource.org/licenses), [What is Free Software?](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), [Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html), and the [class lecture notes](https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4470-OpenSource/blob/master/Modules/04.Licensing/Licensing-S2021-RPI-PatrickMasson-Shortform-RCOS.pdf)

### All of the steps below should be recorded in a file in your Labs directory


1. Give a Creative Commons license to your lab report in your lab folder.

1. Read the [four criteria for Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
2.  Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
    - Write two to five sentences in your lab report.
3.  Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
    - Write two to five sentences in your lab report.
4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of [Why the Web beat Gopher](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain).
    - Do you agree with this claim? Write two to five sentences in your lab report.
5.  Android uses the [Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), [Linux uses the  GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux ) license,
Microsoft [.NET Core uses MIT license]( https://github.com/dotnet/runtime), SailfishOS is [not open source]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS ).
    - Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? (Justification for ONE choice is enough, but be specific and make sure you provide references to articles or web resources).
    - Write your justification in your lab report.
6.  As a table (group of 3-5 students), make up an open source project and a ***business model*** that you could use to make money from it. 
    
    - Pick a license that fits your business model using the [LICENSE chooser by Github](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license). In making your choice, you should read about and consider at least GPL, LGPL, and Apache/BSD, but you are welcome to look at more (my favorite license is [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)). You may use [tldrlegal](https://tldrlegal.com/licenses/browse).
    - Document this project with a README file (`README.md`) describing the project, what the business model is, the license you would choose and why.
    - Create a repository for the project on github and select the license you decided on. Make all of your table collaborators. Put a link to the repository in your lab report..

10.  Take 5 projects from [past RCOS Projects](https://observatory.rcos.io/projects/past) and create a table for which project has which license. for example:

Website | License Present | License
---------|:----------|:-------
https://github.com/rcos/Observatory | Yes | Two Clause BSD License https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license

When you have completed the lab, specify your lab repository on the Submitty gradeable.

This is a short lab and you should have time available. When you are finished, please use the time to work on your [Analysis Project](https://github.com/rcos/CSCI-4470-OpenSource/blob/master/Assignments/Analysis%20Homework/Analysis%20Homework.md)
