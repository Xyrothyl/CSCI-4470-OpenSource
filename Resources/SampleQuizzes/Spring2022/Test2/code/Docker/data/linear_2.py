# 1. Create a model with a single neuron in 1 dense layer and 'relu' activation
# 2. Your model should use 'RMSprop' optimization, and mean squared error for
#    both the loss function and the metric
# 3. Train your model on the 'train_images' and 'train_labels' data from above. Use
#    at least three epochs

# WRITE YOUR CODE BELOW. IT WILL BE MULTIPLE LINES (12/20 points):
